# Sort-Methods-Visually

Implemented the following sort methods in a visual environment:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort 
    
This way you can 'see' the way the computer is working through the items.
Its easier to see on the screen, step by step, how the method sort a list of items.

Included options like:
- List size (can be incremented/decremente)
- Random list
- Decremental list (normally worst case scenario for sorting methods)
- Incremental list
