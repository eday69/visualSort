# Sort-Methods-Visually

Implemented the following sort methods in a visual environment:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort (in process)
    
This way you can 'see' the way the computer is working through the items.
Its easier to see on the screen, step by step, how the method sort a list of items.

Included options like:
- List size (can be incremented/decremente)
- Random list
- Decremental list (normally worst case scenario for sorting methods)
- Incremental list

Currently working on Quick sort. 
It is included on the code, but the visual part is not working (the sort itself works fine).
