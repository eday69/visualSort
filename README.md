# Sort-Methods-Visually

Implemented the Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort in a visual environment. This way you can 'see' the way the computer is working through the items.
Included options like:
- List size (can be incremented/decremente)
- Random list
- Decremental list (normally worst case scenario for sorting methods)
- Incremental list

Currently working on Merge sort. It is included on the code, but the visual part is not working (the sort itself works fine).
